# Demo: Responsive Slider using Picturefill Script 

## Overview

Most responsive sliders are not optimized for mobile devices as they don't include an option for serving up different sized images. So I built one.

Responsive image slider which uses the awesome [Picturefill script](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/tree/1.2.1).
